# SilvortheGrand
Junior C# and C++ developer that mostly works with GitLab (As such this profile here is rather inactive). I've also got some experience with PowerShell and an avid interest in Linux systems, although not a lot of knowledge to accompany it. Developing a game with my very own team in my spare time or playing one of the various other games already on the market.
