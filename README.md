# SilvortheGrand
Certified software developer with extensive project management experience based in Switzerland. Founder of Mountain Creek Studios, developers of "Code 241", a sci-fi first person shooter, due to release on Steam in 2027. I have experience using both Unity and Unreal Engine 5, C#, C++, C and PowerShell. I've also got an avid interest in Linux systems, which I both use for DevOps and as my daily driver. I mostly work with GitLab - as such this profile here is rather inactive.
